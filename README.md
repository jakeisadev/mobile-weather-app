# mobile-weather-app

This was my favorite project to do to date.

I loved learning about API's with my tutor, and seeing what data could be updated into my HTML via JS.

This application allows the user to see weather, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, wind direction, and air pressure in their desired loctaion. It also has a default value of Charlotte, NC to showcase my knowledge of the onLoad event.

With all this said... I initially, prior to getting help from my tutor, made a 80+ line long string of if/else-if's to compensate for each possible weather event that the API coudl render. I also tried to change the background picture according to each event. I eventually got it to work, but, it was certainly not maintainable and was difficult to ascertain due to the strcuture I went with. I was pleased to learn how to easily and cleanly complete this projects JS with one single block of code. I'm glad I asked for help so I could learn how to be a more effective and write better code.

This project is definitely one that I'll revisit through my career for tips on how to write cleaner code. Even though this is relatively simple, it had major implications for me in terms of growth and understanding.
